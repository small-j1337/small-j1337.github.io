        <h1>Human to Human</h1>
        <p>This is usually what I see when I walk around in high school. I know I'm not supposed to expect much,
            but I do miss those good old days where everyone seemed open to a conversation. I created this drawing to cover
            the topic of our online addiction even if that means I suffer from it too. I used the black colors and the light blue
            bubbles to portray the feeling of isolation while having the "road" be a comment section of an Instagram post.

        <h1>Narrative Creature</h1>
        <p>In my English class, I wrote a narrative story about how this girl wants to go to prom, but the moment she tries to find
            her prom dress in her closet, she is shocked to find them missing. It turns out, her dad was selfish and greedy, and decided to sell it
            so that he could afford a computer he always wanted. Then, in my digital art class, I had to illustrate the story
            by drawing a creature. The scene illustrated here is the very beginning of the story, before all of the conflicts start. 
            This hybrid creature consists of a dog, iguana, mantis, whale, and a peacock to represent confidence, self-esteem, and a fancy appearance.

        <h1>That Awesome Feeling</h1>
        <p>A lot of swimmers say that the feeling of eating right after swimming just hits different, in a pleasuring way. I feel the
            same way too after every swim class, as I am exhausted after swimming. I decided to draw myself in a swimsuit
            eating a juicy burger, with a swimming pool tile pattern background. On the tongue, I drew a couple cars and an arrow 
            to symbolize the direction that the burger is headed, which is into my mouth.

        <h1>Underwater</h1>
        <p>So I decided to draw a picture of my brother swimming underwater. Originally, I was planning on just drawing
            him swimming in a swimming pool, but then I got bored and wanted to add some ocean like elements, like sea turtles
            and the sunlight patterns on the ocean floor.

        <h1>Hungry</h1>
        <p>When I went to Japan for the first time, the first thing that caught my attention was the food. Not only was the food authentic,
            it was cheap too, and even the foods sold at convenience stores were delicious. I also found the restaurants interesting, as they were often
            small, but warm and cozy. In this piece, I decided to draw myself enjoying a bowl of Udon noodles, and a plate of sushi. I also drew the transparent
            effect on my body to show the noodles being consumed.

        <h1>Mother's Day</h1>
        <p>When my family and I went to New York in the winter of 2022, my mom and I took a selfie of us
            having fun in Central Park. This was a very memorable moment, so I wanted to draw a picture of it. </p>

        <h1>You Have Instagram???</h1>
        <p>So, funny story, I created my Instagram account like several years later
            than all of my other classmates did. So I was pretty new to it and felt like
            this was a great way to connect with others. About a week, a lot of classmates I know
            started following me, so I just assumed they know who I am and that they really care about me. Well, I was wrong.
            There was this one day I started talking about my Instagram posts to some of my classmates who were following me, and they 
            ended up saying "You Have Instagram???" as in they didn't know I had an Instagram page. So I decided to create a 
            simple comic strip about it to show that not all of your followers are loyal, and that social media can be very decieving.

        <h1>Know Your Rights!</h1>
        <p>I created this poster to submit to the young worker's rights contest. I felt like this was good practice 
            for me to create an infographic to spread awareness of a social issue, as I know I will have to face something like 
            this in the future. In this piece, I used the bridge or the "higher ground" to symbolize safety and the polluted river below
            represent the hazards in the workforce.
